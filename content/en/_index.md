### **Today's Headlines**

```
Taotian Group dropped the DeepPHY benchmark, showing that even top-tier VLMs kinda suck at physics games.
Meanwhile, buzz about Apple CEO Tim Cook potentially stepping down next year has everyone speculating about the company's direction.
Engineers? Their gig is evolving from just coding to orchestrating entire AI agent dev teams.
And get this: an AI app that lets you chat with digital versions of deceased loved ones is stirring up some serious ethical drama.
Forget basic automation; the real AI shake-up, some argue, will happen when it merges with quantum computing.
```

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **Taotian Group's DeepPHY benchmark** just dropped a bombshell, showing even the top-tier Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are pretty terrible at physics games! Think *Angry Birds* and five other similar challenges where their performance was worse than random guessing. This glaring gap between AI 'understanding' physics and 'doing' physics is a huge deal 🔥. The study, [published on the WeChat Official Account (AI News)](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzIzNjc1NzUzMw==&mid=2247843798&idx=3&sn=46290e0d81778fa3bedd9f4de4b708e1), reveals that even GPT-4o can't translate descriptive knowledge into precise interactive control – a critical roadblock for embodied AI right now. If you're into this, you can dive deeper by [reading its academic paper - (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05405) or just [check out the open-source code - (AI News)](https://github.com/XinrunXu/DeepPHY) to experience this ultimate test of physical intelligence yourself! ✨<br/>![AI News: Success Rate of Various VLMs on DeepPHY](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01ka6g39hef668m85y982sjw5c.avif)<br/>![AI News: Six Physics Games in DeepPHY](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01ka6g3g8xfnmr4cmg81pgv7r1.avif)

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Apple CEO Tim Cook's** rumored departure as early as next year has set the tech world ablaze, sparking a deep debate about Apple's very soul. Everyone pretty much agrees Cook is a legendary operations guru, but he's also often dinged for lacking Jobs-level product vision, leading to stagnant software experiences like **Siri**, as [this in-depth analysis (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=45940681) points out. Hardware engineering chief **John Ternus** is seen as a front-runner to take the reins, which might signal Apple will stick to its steady, operations-first approach rather than launching a disruptive innovation revolution. Just sayin'! 🍎

2.  **Software engineers** are in for an epic evolution, transforming from mere coders to conductors, and then to orchestrators, set to manage an entire army of AI agents! As [this excellent article by Addy Osmani (AI News)](https://addyo.substack.com/p/conductors-to-orchestrators-the-future) lays out, our core value will shift towards strategic design and quality control, offloading tedious coding tasks to AI in parallel. While this [future workflow - (AI News)](https://x.com/shao__meng/status/1990038442508787815) sounds super tempting, it also throws down new gauntlets for our task decomposition and coordination skills. Get ready! 🛠️<br/>![AI News: Evolution of Engineer Role from Coding to Orchestration](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2025/11/news_01ka6g3sz3f53vgkqkq3qeg08w.avif)

3.  Talk about real-life *Black Mirror*! An **AI app called 2wai**, developed by a former Disney star, allows users to chat with digital versions of deceased loved ones, sparking a massive ethical uproar. Pitched as building 'human living archives,' the app has seriously spooked the public, raising deep concerns about digital immortality, data privacy, and emotional manipulation. As [this heated Reddit discussion post shows (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oy9sh1/former_disney_star_sparks_controversy_for_his_ai/), this tech is forcing us to confront a heavy question: just where *are* the boundaries of technology? 🤯

4.  Is the current AI craze a 'bubble' or a 'revolution'? A [thought-provoking view (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oy0up7/are_we_misreading_the_ai_bubble_or_are_we/) argues that many are mixing up linear **AI automation** with non-linear, exponential **AI intelligence**—and the latter is the real game-changer. The article predicts that **AI's true disruption** will come from its fusion with **quantum computing**, giving us the super-ability to simulate entire physical worlds. So for investors, it's not about whether AI is overvalued; it's about whether they're ready for a new, intelligence-driven economic era.

5.  The **Vercel team** just dropped some golden insights on building internal AI agents, stressing that agents aren't magic bullets but rather "surgical tools" for specific problems. They found AI really shines with "low-hanging fruit"—those highly repetitive, low-cognitive-load tasks—and that designing **human oversight loops** is critical for safety and quality. Through [this detailed blog post (AI News)](https://vercel.com/blog/what-we-learned-building-agents-at-vercel), Vercel showcases concrete examples of how they pragmatically apply AI to business processes for massive efficiency gains.

### Social Media Buzz

1.  A simple yet profound discovery is shaking up the community: the **tone of voice** you use when talking to AI directly dictates the quality and depth of its answers! [This interesting experiment on Reddit (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oya0k4/the_influence_of_prompt_tone_on_ai_output_latent/) shows that using a respectful, cooperative tone prompts the model to deliver more detailed, insightful responses, while rude commands just get you shrug-worthy replies. Maybe politeness isn't just a virtue, but the key to unlocking deeper capabilities within AI's **latent space**? Get all the [details here (AI News)](https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/1oya0k4/the_influence_of_prompt_tone_on_ai_output_latent/)! 🤯

2.  A **boss on social media** just dropped a soul-crushing lament that hits home for countless tech managers. The absolute worst? Giving your team top-tier AI coding tools like **Claude Code** and **Cursor**, only to find them gathering dust, unused and unloved. [This short but thought-provoking post (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1989846842784583974) perfectly captures that massive chasm between advanced tools and team adoption. Seriously, [check this out (AI News)](https://x.com/oran_ge/status/1989846842784583974) – it's a real head-scratcher! 🤷‍♂️

3.  **AI guru Ethan Mollick** just spilled the tea, handing ChatGPT users a universal fix for almost all their problems! He sharply points out that a whopping **95%** of user issues can be solved by simply enabling 'Extended Thinking.' [This wise tweet (AI News)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1989738355199017249) reminds us: instead of expecting AI to nail it in one go, guide it through structured, step-by-step thinking. That's the real secret sauce to unleashing its full potential! Find the [original here (AI News)](https://x.com/emollick/status/1989738355199017249)! ✨
