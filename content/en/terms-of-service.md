# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka 'the Site' or 'we'). Before you jump in and use our services, please, pretty please, read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're essentially giving us a thumbs-up and agreeing to these terms.

## 1. About Our Services
Our Site? It's your go-to for awesome paid subscription content and exclusive membership services! 🌟 Think blog posts, unique resources, cool e-books, and vibrant community interactions. Just a heads-up: some of our juiciest content is exclusively for our subscribed members.

## 2. User Registration & Accounts
*   To snag an account, you (the user!) just need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
*   Your account is your responsibility! You're on the hook for its security and everything that happens with it. Absolutely **NO** transferring or sharing your account – keep it personal, folks!
*   And just so you know, if you ever break these terms, the Site totally reserves the right to **hit pause or even terminate** your account. Let's keep things chill, shall we?

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
*   Our subscription services? They're billed monthly or annually, and you'll see all the deets about the fees clearly laid out on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💸
*   All your payments are handled securely through third-party payment platforms like Stripe or PayPal. Phew! That means **we don't store any of your payment info** here on the Site. Your privacy is key! 🔒
*   Heads up: your subscription will **auto-renew**! ✨ Unless, of course, you decide to cancel before your current billing cycle wraps up.
*   So, about our **14-Day Refund Policy**! 🤝 If you're a first-time subscriber and you're not totally thrilled with our service within 14 days of purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just hit us up at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this refund, by the way. After 14 days, or if you're not a first-timer, **no refunds** on payments are issued unless the law says otherwise. Fair's fair!

## 4. Content Use & Intellectual Property
*   First things first: all the original content here is **copyrighted by the Site (hubtoday)**. © That means no copying, reprinting, or using it for commercial stuff without getting our green light first! Let's respect those creative vibes.
*   As a user, you're getting **non-exclusive, non-transferable access** to our content. Think of it as your personal pass for learning and reading – pretty neat, huh?
*   Thinking about using our stuff for commercial purposes or quoting a bunch of it? Awesome! Just hit up the Site to get authorization first. We're usually pretty cool about it! 😉

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
*   Listen up on user behavior: it's a strict **NO-GO** for uploading, posting, or sharing anything illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or content that messes with other people's rights. Let's keep it clean and respectful! 🚫
*   Also, **don't even think about** using technical tricks to bulk download, scrape, or crack our member-only content. That's just not cool! 🙅
*   The Site has the right to remove any inappropriate content and will absolutely **ban users who don't play by the rules**. Consider this your friendly warning! 😉

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
*   Heads up! We (the Site) totally reserve the right to change, hit pause on, or even terminate any part or all of our services at any time. And yep, we might do it without a heads-up. It's just how the tech cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️
*   Now, if our content becomes temporarily unavailable because of something like an act of God, a server hiccup, or a third-party service going down (ugh!), the Site **won't be on the hook for any compensation**. We're doing our best, but sometimes things are just out of our hands! ☁️

## 7. Disclaimers
*   Quick disclaimer: the info we dish out on this Site? It's strictly for reference! It **doesn't count** as professional advice – we're talking financial, legal, medical, or anything like that. Always chat with a pro for that stuff! 🧠
*   And just to be super clear: for any direct or indirect losses you might rack up from using our content or services, the Site is **not responsible, period**. Use at your own risk, folks! 🚧

## 8. Governing Law
*   About the legal stuff: these Terms of Service are all about U.S. California law! ⚖️ They'll be governed and interpreted by those laws, without even thinking about conflict of laws principles. Keepin' it Californian!
*   Got a beef or a dispute related to these terms? Let's try to hash it out friendly-style first! 🤝 If we can't quite agree, you're agreeing to take it to the courts in Santa Clara County, California. So, you know, legal stuff with a local twist!
