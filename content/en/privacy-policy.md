# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 This Privacy Policy breaks down how we collect, use, and spill the beans about your info when you use our Service. It also gives you the lowdown on your privacy rights and what the law does to keep you safe.

So, here's the deal: We use your personal data to power up and fine-tune our Service. By hopping on board and using our Service, you're essentially saying 'Yep!' to us collecting and using your info according to this Privacy Policy.

## Explanations & Definitions

### Explanations
Just a heads-up: words capitalized at the start have specific meanings, defined right below. Doesn't matter if they're singular or plural, these definitions stick.

### Definitions
Okay, for the sake of this Privacy Policy, here's what these terms mean:

- **Account** means a unique account created for You to access our Service or parts of our Service.

- **Affiliate** is an entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with a party, where "control" means ownership of 50% or more of the shares, equity interest or other securities entitled to vote for election of directors or other managing authority.

- **Company** (referred to as either "the Company", "We", "Us" or "Our" in this Agreement) refers to **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are small files placed on Your computer, mobile device or any other device by a website, containing details of Your browsing history on that website among its many uses.

- **Country** refers to: California, United States.

- **Device** means any device that can access the Service such as a computer, a cellphone or a digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual.

- **Service** refers to the Website.

- **Service Provider** means any natural or legal person who processes data on behalf of the Company. It refers to third-party companies or individuals employed by the Company to facilitate the Service, to provide the Service on behalf of the Company, to perform services related to the Service or to assist the Company in analyzing how the Service is used.

- **Usage Data** refers to data collected automatically, either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).

- **Website** refers to **hubtoday**, accessible from `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means the individual accessing or using the Service, or the company, or other legal entity on behalf of which such individual is accessing or using the Service, as applicable.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
When you're cruising on our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or figure out who you are. This "personally identifiable information" could include, but isn't limited to, stuff like:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Heads up: Usage Data gets automatically scooped up when you use the Service. No extra effort needed!

What's in Usage Data, you ask? It could be your device's Internet Protocol address (think IP address), browser type and version, which pages you hit up on our Service, when and how long you hung out there, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic bits.

If you're accessing the Service on your mobile device, we might automatically grab some info. This includes, but isn't limited to, your mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic data.

We might also snag info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, or when you're using it on your mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
Alright, let's talk tracking! 🍪 We use Cookies and other similar tech to keep tabs on what's happening on our Service and stash away some info. We're talking beacons, tags, and scripts – all designed to collect data, track activity, and help us fine-tune and analyze what we do. Here's a peek at the tech we might be using:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies:** Think of a Cookie as a tiny file that lands on your device. You're the boss – you can tell your browser to reject all Cookies or give you a heads-up when one's coming your way. But, if you don't say yes to Cookies, some parts of our Service might play hard to get. Unless you've already tweaked your browser settings to give Cookies the cold shoulder, chances are our Service will be using them.
- **Web Beacons:** Ever heard of a web beacon? Well, some parts of our Service and our emails might have these tiny electronic files (also known as clear GIFs, pixel tags, or single-pixel GIFs). They're pretty neat because they let us, for example, count folks who've visited specific pages or opened an email. They also help with other website stats, like seeing which sections are popular or making sure our systems and servers are running smoothly.

Now, Cookies come in two main flavors: "Persistent" and "Session" Cookies. Persistent ones stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you've gone offline. Session Cookies, on the other hand, vanish into thin air the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We use both types – Session and Persistent Cookies – for these reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type:** Session Cookies
  - **Managed by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These are the backbone! 💪 They're absolutely vital for getting you the services available on our Website and letting you use its cool features. They're key for verifying who you are and keeping those pesky fraudsters away from your account. Honestly, without 'em, the services you're asking for just wouldn't work. So, we only use these to make sure you get what you came for.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type:** Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These Cookies identify if users have accepted the use of cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type:** Persistent Cookies
  - **Managed by:** Us
  - **Purpose:** These Cookies are super helpful! They let us remember your choices when you're using the Website – things like your login deets or what language you prefer. Basically, they're here to give you a smoother, more personalized experience so you don't have to keep re-entering your preferences every single time you visit. Sweet! ✨

### How We Use Your Personal Data
So, why do we use your Personal Data? The Company might use it for these reasons:

- **To Power and Maintain Our Service:** Yep, this includes keeping an eye on how our Service is being used. 👀
- **To Manage Your Account:** This is all about handling your registration as a user. Your Personal Data lets you tap into all the cool features available to registered users.
- **For Our Contractual Stuff:** We use your data to create, stick to, and fulfill purchase contracts for products, items, or services you've snagged, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service.
- **To Reach Out to You:** We might ping you via email, phone calls, SMS, or other digital means (like push notifications from our mobile app). This is for updates, info about features, products, or services you've signed up for, including vital security updates when they're needed.
- **For News & Deals:** We love to share! We might send you news, special offers, and general information about other awesome goods, services, and events we're offering that are similar to what you've already bought or asked about. (Unless you've told us to chill on those updates, of course 😉).
- **To Handle Your Requests:** Got a request for us? Your data helps us process and manage whatever you throw our way.
- **For Business Moves:** If we ever get into a merger, sale, reorganization, or transfer of assets (whether it's business as usual or something like bankruptcy), your info might be used to evaluate or carry out that process. Basically, if our company changes hands, your Personal Data might be part of the package.
- **For Other Cool Stuff:** We might also use your info for things like data analysis, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promos are actually working, and generally making our Service, products, marketing, and your whole experience even better! ✨

Wondering when we might share your personal info? Here are the scenarios:

- **With Service Providers:** We might share your personal info with our Service Providers to help us monitor and analyze how our Service is being used, and yes, sometimes to reach out to you.
- **During Business Shifts:** If we're ever involved in a merger, selling off assets, getting financing, or another company buys us out (partially or fully), your personal info might be shared or transferred as part of that deal or during negotiations. It's just part of big business moves!
- **With Our Affiliates:** We might share your info with our sister companies (Affiliates). Don't worry, though – we'll make sure they commit to this Privacy Policy. "Affiliates" means our parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture buddies, or any other company we control or share control with.
- **With Business Partners:** We sometimes team up with business partners to bring you certain products, services, or cool promotions. In those cases, we might share your info with them.
- **With Other Users:** If you're out there sharing personal info or interacting with other users in public areas of the Service, remember that everyone can see that info, and it might even get shared publicly outside the Service. So, share wisely! 😉
- **When You Say 'Go!':** For any other reason, if you give us your explicit consent, we might disclose your personal information.

### How Long We Keep Your Personal Data
So, how long do we hang onto your Personal Data? 🕰️ The Company will only keep it for as long as needed for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll also hold onto and use your data as much as required to meet our legal duties (like if the law says we have to), sort out any disagreements, and enforce our agreements and policies.

We'll also keep Usage Data for our internal analysis (think: making things better behind the scenes 😉). Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter time. The exceptions? If we use it to beef up our Service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally required to keep it for longer.

### Transferring Your Personal Data
Okay, so where does your info (including Personal Data) go? 🌍 It's processed at the Company's offices and wherever else the folks handling it are located. This means your data might get moved to — and stored on — computers outside your state, province, or even country. Keep in mind, data protection laws in those places might be different from where you are.

By saying 'yes' to this Privacy Policy and then handing over your info, you're giving us the green light for that transfer. Just so you know! 👍

Don't sweat it too much, though! The Company promises to take every reasonable step to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're confident they've got solid controls in place, especially when it comes to the security of your data and other personal info.

### Deleting Your Personal Data
Wanna wipe the slate clean? ✨ You've totally got the right to delete, or ask us for a hand in deleting, the Personal Data we've gathered about you.

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info right from within the app or website itself. Pretty handy!

You can update, tweak, or delete your info anytime by logging into your account (if you've got one) and heading to the account settings section where you can manage your personal details. Or hey, feel free to just contact us directly to ask for access, corrections, or deletion of any personal information you've given us.

Just a heads-up: sometimes we might need to hang onto certain info if we have a legal duty or a valid reason to do so. It's not personal! 😉

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
Big business moves like a merger, acquisition, or asset sale could mean your Personal Data gets transferred. If that happens, we'll give you a heads-up before your data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy. Just keeping you in the loop! 🤝

#### Law Enforcement
Sometimes, we might have to spill the beans on your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) send us a valid request. It's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes! 🤷‍♀️

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:

- Stick to our legal duties.
- Guard and defend the Company's rights or property.
- Stop or investigate any sneaky behavior linked to the Service.
- Keep Service users or the public safe and sound. 💖
- Steer clear of legal trouble.

### Security of Your Personal Data
Your Personal Data's security is a big deal to us, truly! 🛡️ But let's be real: no method of sending data over the Internet or storing it electronically is ever 100% foolproof. While we bust our butts to use commercially acceptable ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it'll be absolutely, totally, completely secure. Just something to keep in mind!

## Children's Privacy
Okay, let's talk about the little ones. 👶 Our Service isn't for anyone under 13. We absolutely do not knowingly collect personally identifiable info from anyone below that age. If you're a parent or guardian and you've realized your child has given us Personal Data, please, please get in touch! If we ever find out we've collected Personal Data from a child under 13 without verified parental consent, we'll spring into action to delete that info from our servers. Fast!

And hey, if we need your consent to process your info, and your country says a parent needs to give the thumbs-up for that, we might ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that data. Gotta follow the rules! 📜

## Links to Other Websites
Heads up! 🔗 Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. If you click on one of those third-party links, you'll be whisked away to their site. We seriously recommend you check out the Privacy Policy of *every single site* you visit. Better safe than sorry!

Just so we're clear: we have zero control over, and take absolutely no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services. What happens there, stays there (with them, that is!).

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
Things change, and so might our Privacy Policy! 🔄 We might update it now and then. When we do, we'll let you know by slapping the new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any big changes kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date at the very top of this Privacy Policy. No surprises here! 😉

We suggest you peek at this Privacy Policy every so often to catch any changes. Any updates to this Privacy Policy become official the moment they're posted right here. So, stay tuned!
